# Transfer-Learning-for-Detection-of-Plant-Leaf-Diseases-
Agriculture is the one of biggest factor in every countries economy and the major problem facing by many agriculturalists is detection of diseases in the early stage and using correct pesticides and avoid major losses during cultivation. In my research work a dataset with 14 different types of diseases of 6 different types of plants were used for early detection in diseases in plant leaves. Deep learning models like GoogleNet, ResNet101 and MobileNet are used for classifying the type of diseases in various plant leaves. Evaluation metrics like precision, recall and f1-score were used for analyzing the results of the model.
